# HTML

To edit your [DeckDeckGo] presentation you could either use **HTML** or **Markdown**.

The default language is **HTML**. It's also the recommended language as it offers you more flexibility specially in terms of styling.

If you have chosen to edit your presentation using HTML, begin by editing the `index.html` of your project as suggested in the chapter [Concept](/slides/concept).

Whereas if you prefer to edit your talk using **Markdown**, have a look at [the next chapter](/edit/markdown).
