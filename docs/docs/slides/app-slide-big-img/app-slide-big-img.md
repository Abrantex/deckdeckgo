### From a CDN

It's recommended to use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) if you want to use this template from a CDN. To do so, add the following include script in the main HTML file of your project:

```
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@deckdeckgo/slide-big-img@latest/dist/deckdeckgo-slide-big-img/deckdeckgo-slide-big-img.esm.js"></script>
<script nomodule="" src="https://unpkg.com/@deckdeckgo/slide-big-img@latest/dist/deckdeckgo-slide-big-img/deckdeckgo-slide-big-img.js"></script>
```

### From NPM

To install this template in your project from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deckdeckgo/slide-big-img) run the following command:

```bash
npm install @deckdeckgo/slide-big-img
```

### Framework integration

The [Stencil documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview) provide examples of framework integration for [Angular](https://stenciljs.com/docs/angular), [React](https://stenciljs.com/docs/react), [Vue](https://stenciljs.com/docs/vue) and [Ember](https://stenciljs.com/docs/ember).

That being said, commonly, you might either `import` or `load` it:

```

## Usage

The "Big Image" slide's Web Component could be integrated using the tag `<deckgo-slide-big-img/>`.

```
<deckgo-slide-big-img
     img-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noelmace/deckdeckgo/big-img/webcomponents/slides/big-img/showcase/big-deckdeckgo.jpg"
     img-divisions="500;1100;1700"
     axis="y">

```

### Slots

The slots `title` is optional (it is not displayed but could be use for the navigation). Otherwise no particular slots are currently available in order to display additional information on this template.

### Notes

Optionally a slot `notes` could be use to add some notes regarding the particular slide. These will be automatically `displayed` in the [remote control](https://deckdeckgo.app).

If you are using the [DeckDeckGo] starter kit and wish to make your notes accessible to anyone, you will need to mark them with the attribute `show`.
