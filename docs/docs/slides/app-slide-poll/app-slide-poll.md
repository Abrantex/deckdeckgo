```
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@deckdeckgo/slide-poll@latest/dist/deckdeckgo-slide-poll/deckdeckgo-slide-poll.esm.js"></script>

```

```

That being said, commonly, you might either `import` or `load` it:

## Usage

The "Poll" slide's Web Component could be integrated using the tag `<deckgo-slide-poll/>`.

```
<deckgo-slide-poll poll-link="https://deckdeckgo.com" socket-url="https://api.deckdeckgo.com">
    <h1 slot="question">Do you like my presentation so far?</h1>
    <p slot="answer-1">It is super</p>
    <p slot="answer-2">Meh</p>
    <p slot="answer-3">I could'nt care less</p>
    <p slot="answer-4">Tell me why</p>
    <p slot="answer-5">Ain't nothin' but a heartache</p>
    <p slot="how-to">Go to <a href="https://poll.deckdeckgo.com">poll.deckdeckgo.com</a> and use the code {0}</p>
    <p slot="awaiting-votes">Awaiting first votes</p>
</deckgo-slide-poll>
```

### Slots

The slots `question` and at least one `answer` should be provided. Answer slots have to be provided as `answer-x` where  `x` is a number bigger than 0.

The slot `how-to` and `awaiting-votes` are optional, still, it's probably for best of your audience to provide these.

Note also that if you provide a string `{0}` in the content of your slot `how-to`, the information will be automatically converted to the real key of your poll (the key your audience could use to reach it and vote).

### Notes

Optionally a slot `notes` could be use to add some notes regarding the particular slide. These will be automatically `displayed` in the [remote control](https://deckdeckgo.app).

If you are using the [DeckDeckGo] starter kit and wish to make your notes accessible to anyone, you would need to mark them with an attribute `show`.
