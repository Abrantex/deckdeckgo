    <deckgo-slide-playground src="https://codepen.io/peterpeterparker/pen/dyGbOZm">

## Installation

This template could be added to your presentation using the following methods.

> If you are using our Starter Kit, no need to worry about this, this template is included, therefore you could skip the "Installation" chapter.

### From a CDN

It's recommended to use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) if you want to use this template from a CDN. To do so, add the following include script in the main HTML file of your project:

```
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@deckdeckgo/slide-playground@latest/dist/deckdeckgo-slide-playground/deckdeckgo-slide-playground.esm.js"></script>
<script nomodule="" src="https://unpkg.com/@deckdeckgo/slide-playground@latest/dist/deckdeckgo-slide-playground/deckdeckgo-slide-playground.js"></script>
```

### From NPM

To install this template in your project from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deckdeckgo/slide-playground) run the following command:

```bash
npm install @deckdeckgo/slide-playground
```

### Framework integration

The [Stencil documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview) provide examples of framework integration for [Angular](https://stenciljs.com/docs/angular), [React](https://stenciljs.com/docs/react), [Vue](https://stenciljs.com/docs/vue) and [Ember](https://stenciljs.com/docs/ember).

That being said, commonly, you might either `import` or `load` it:

#### Import

```
import '@deckdeckgo/slide-playground';
```

#### Loader

```
import { defineCustomElements as deckDeckGoSlideElement } from '@deckdeckgo/slide-playground/dist/loader';
deckDeckGoSlideElement();
```

## Usage

The "Playground" slide's Web Component could be integrated using the tag `<deckgo-slide-playground/>`.

```
<deckgo-slide-playground src="https://codepen.io/peterpeterparker/pen/dyGbOZm">
  <h1 slot="title">My Codepen</h1>
</deckgo-slide-playground>
```

### Slots

Both slots `title` and `content` are optional.

### Notes

Optionally a slot `notes` could be use to add some notes regarding the particular slide. These will be automatically `displayed` in the [remote control](https://deckdeckgo.app).

If you are using the [DeckDeckGo] starter kit and wish to make your notes accessible to anyone, you will need to mark them with the attribute `show`.
