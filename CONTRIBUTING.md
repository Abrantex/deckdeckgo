On the other side, our publication engine is developed with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). 

## Issues

We are flagging our [issues](https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo/issues) with the labels `good first issue` when we think that the issue is accessible without too much experience and know-how of our project.
