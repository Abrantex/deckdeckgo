Hey there üëã

Are you interested to contribute to our open source project? That would be awesome, we are always looking for contributors üëç

The following guide is there to try to guide you through the process in case you would not know where to get started. If you have further questions, of course we are happy to help, just ping us on our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/deckdeckgo/shared_invite/enQtNzM0NjMwOTc3NTI0LTBlNmFhODNhYmRkMWUxZmU4ZTQ2MDJiNjlmYWZiODNjMDU5OGRjYThlZmZjMTc5YmQ3MzUzMDlhMzk0ZDgzMDY) channel.

## How to get Involved

Everyone is welcomed to contribute to our projects, no matter how experienced you are. [DeckDeckGo] has an important learning purpose for our selves and we would be happy if its experience would also be profitable to others in terms of improvements. 

## Technical facts

[DeckDeckGo] is a mix of applications, components, functions and infrastructure. You could have a look to our [README](README.md) which lists of all these.

In a really short summary, all our applications and components are developed with [Stencil.JS](https://stenciljs.com) Web Components.
 
On the other side, our publication engine is developed with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). 

## Issues

We are flagging our [issues](https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo/issues) with the labels `good first issue` when we think that the issue is accessible without too much experience and know-how of our project. We are also flagging issue with the label `question` when we need your inputs. It could be general questions as brainstorming regarding UX, anything.

You are most welcomed to find these kinds of issues to get started but obviously if you would find none of these, don't hesitate to take over other types of issues if they inspire you.

In any case, ping us to get start, your help would be super appreciated!

## Bugs and features requests

Some bugs (sh*t happens) might not yet been reported. Likewise, your awesome ideas to make [DeckDeckGo] better are always wanted. Therefore don't hesitate to open new [issues](https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo/issues) but if you are unsure about if it's the right place or if you would like to discuss it first, go to [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/deckdeckgo/shared_invite/enQtNzM0NjMwOTc3NTI0LTBlNmFhODNhYmRkMWUxZmU4ZTQ2MDJiNjlmYWZiODNjMDU5OGRjYThlZmZjMTc5YmQ3MzUzMDlhMzk0ZDgzMDY) for that purpose.

## Development

Developing features or fixes in our Web Components, documentation or remote control is relatively straight forward, as each of them are self contained and have few dependencies.

On the other hand, before developing improvements related to our editor ("studio"), it will need a bit of configuration in order to be able to run it locally, notably because its keys and tokens (Firebase etc.) are not exposed in this repository. Ping me (David) on one of our channels, I'll be happy to share these information to help you get started.
