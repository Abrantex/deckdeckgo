### Remote control

Cherry on the cake üçíüéÇ [DeckDeckGo] comes with its [Progressive Web App](https://deckdeckgo.app) that allows you to remote control your presentation üöÄ

## Getting Started

[DeckDeckGo] provides a [CLI](https://github.com/fluster/create-deckdeckgo) and a [starter kit](https://github.com/fluster/deckdeckgo-starter).

To get started and **to create your presentation**, run the following command and follow the prompt:

```bash
npm init deckdeckgo
```

Once your presentation created, go to your new project's folder and start editing `src/index.html` to prepare your slides and content for your talk üòâ

## Installing DeckDeckGo in any projects

If you wish to use the [DeckDeckGo] presentation tool without any tooling, use it directly in your project from a CDN, using a simple script include, or install it from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deckdeckgo).

### Using DeckDeckGo from a CDN

It's recommended to use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) to use the [DeckDeckGo] from a CDN. To do so, add the following include script in the main HTML file of your project:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/deckdeckgo@latest/dist/deckdeckgo.js"></script>
```

### Install DeckDeckGo from NPM

Install [DeckDeckGo] in your project from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deckdeckgo) using the following command:

```bash
npm install deckdeckgo
```

### Framework integration

The [Stencil documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview) provide examples of framework integration for [Angular](https://stenciljs.com/docs/angular), [React](https://stenciljs.com/docs/react), [Vue](https://stenciljs.com/docs/vue) and [Ember](https://stenciljs.com/docs/ember).

## Editing

[DeckDeckGo] is a deck of slides where each slide has its own layout and behaviour. Their content could be edited and structured using the provided `slots` and other attributes.

The deck should be declared using the tag `<deckgo-deck/>` and each slide should be added to its children.

```
<deckgo-deck>
  <deckgo-slide-title>
    <h1 slot="title">The first slide</h1>
    <p slot="content">
      Hello World üöÄ
    </p>
  </deckgo-slide-title>
  
  <deckgo-slide-content>
      <h1 slot="title">The second slide</h1>
  </deckgo-slide-content>
</deckgo-deck>
```

The [detailed documentation](doc/slides/slides.md) display all templates and all options available for each slides.

## Navigation

Furthermore than the default swiping, the [DeckDeckGo] deck expose some asynchronous methods in case you would like to add navigation features to your presentation.

These features are described in the separate [documentation](doc/features/navigation.md) about navigation. 

## Extra features

Finally [DeckDeckGo] offers extra features, as for example a print feature or a full screen toggler, which could be added to your presentation too.

These features are described in the separate [documentation](doc/features/extra.md) about extra features.

## Lazy loading

In order to lazy load the images of your presentation, provide their url using the attribute `data-src` instead of `src`. [DeckDeckGo] will then take care of loading them only when needed.

```
<img data-src="https://deckdeckgo.com/assets/img/deckdeckgo.png"/>
```

## Theming

[DeckDeckGo] offers various theming options which could be set using CSS variables and which are described in their respective slides' templates [documentation](doc/slides/slides.md).

*Note: If you would miss or need further theming options, don't hesitate to open an issue and/or submit a PR, it would be my pleasure to add more theming flexibility and options*

## Backstory

I had the opportunity to talk about Web Components and Ionic. While I was developing my presentation it came to my mind that I was not really following what I was about to present, that's why I wrapped up together [DeckDeckGo], this new tool to create lightweight presentation using HTML, Web Components and Ionic.
